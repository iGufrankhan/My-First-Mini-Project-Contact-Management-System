                                       Through this project, I improved my understanding of C++ classes and data structures. I learned how to manage memory dynamically and handle file I/O operations effectively. 
                                       I learned how to manage memory dynamically and handle file I/O operations effectively. Debugging taught me to identify and fix errors systematically.

                                               The project consists of several classes such as Contact and ContactManager. 
                                               Each class has specific methods to add, delete, and display contacts. User interaction is managed through a simple command-line interface.

                                               Developing this project was a valuable learning experience that significantly improved my programming skills, particularly in C++ development and software design.

Reflecting on these aspects not only helps you articulate your learning journey but also provides insights into areas where you can continue to grow as a developer.

This is my first mini project in c++..

"My project is a contact management system developed in C++. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage contacts efficiently. The system includes functionalities such as adding new contacts, searching for contacts by name, updating contact information, and deleting contacts. It is designed to be user-friendly with a simple command-line interface. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming, object-oriented design principles, and data management techniques."

About my project..
FEATURES..
Add Contact: Users can add new contacts with validation for phone number format.
Search Contact: Users can search for contacts by entering either the first name or last name.
Help: Displays a help menu explaining the functionalities and usage of the program.
Data Persistence: Contacts are stored in a text file (number.txt) using file handling operations.

  FUNCTIONS DETAILS..
Input Validation: Ensures that phone numbers entered contain exactly 10 digits and consist only of numerical characters.
User Interface: Utilizes simple console-based menus and commands (system("cls")) for interaction.
Exit Mechanism: Provides an option to exit the program gracefully.



for future Improvements..
Potential enhancements could include adding editing and deleting functionalities for contacts, implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, and enhancing error handling and user input validation.
